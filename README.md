Hello! This GitHub repository is created to simplify the setup process for wings and the Pterodactyl panel, as well as to optimize Linux for stable operation and configure Anti-Disk-Fill. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, feel free to reach out to us on Discord: `sparixxpogi`.

To set up wings/panel quickly, use the following command:
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://pterodactyl-installer.se)
```

To optimize Linux for wings usage (courtesy of avex.99), use:
```bash

```

To configure Anti-Disk-Fill (from luketsu_), use:
```bash

```
